Key objectives include applying generative AI concepts to synthesize answers, extracting information from PDFs (splitting, embedding using Sentence-Transformers, storing in FAISS), demonstrating the benefits of retrieval in generative QA, implementing the RAG pipeline using LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, and FAISS, and practicing prompt engineering.\n",
        "*   **Implemented RAG Pipeline Structure**: The RAG pipeline involves several stages:\n",
        "    *   **Environment Setup**: Google Drive was successfully mounted, and necessary libraries like `langchain`, `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, and `pypdf` were installed.\n",
        "    *   **Document Loading**: A PDF document named `\"document.pdf.pdf\"` containing 401 pages was successfully loaded using `PyPDFLoader`.\n",
        "    *   **Document Processing (Defined)**: Code for chunking documents using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with `chunk_size=500` and `chunk_overlap=50` is defined.\n",
        "    *   **Embedding and Vector Store (Defined)**: Code to create embeddings with `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` using the `\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"` model and to build a FAISS vector store with a retriever is defined.\n",
        "    *   **Generative Model Setup (Defined)**: The `google/flan-t5-large` model and tokenizer are configured, and a `text2text-generation` pipeline, along with a `query_rag` function (with parameters like `max_new_tokens=200`, `temperature=0.9`), are defined.\n",
